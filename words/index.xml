      <description>There are over eight hundred species of tarantula in the world - only thirty of which have been documented in the United States. Billy had caught over sixty of them.
He kept them in glass jars - empty yogurts. They were $2.50 a yogurt, $1.99 if they were on sale nearing expiration. They were all Greek-style yogurt with a foil top - no reusable lids. That was just fine - Billy took to making tops for the jars out of whatever flora and foliage was around when he found a lil guy.</description>
