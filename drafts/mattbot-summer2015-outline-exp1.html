    <h1>Paper: Using GPs to model human reward-based decision problems with infinite choice sets</h1>
<h2>Motivations</h2>
<h3>Major</h3>
<ul>
<li>normative model for reward-based decision making with an infinite choice set</li>
<li>previous function learning centered on learning ground truth (e.g. Griffiths 2009)</li>
<li>actually gives us a normative parameterization of the GP to study, which is not true for using GPs to infer functions generated from different familiesm which is how previous studies work</li>
<li>our approach of generating stimuli with GPs rather than from families of functions allows us to systematically study GPs' effectiveness as inference machines. (maybe the same as above?)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Minor</h3>
<ul>
<li>shows direct influence of structure independent of direct reinforcement</li>
<li>allows us to study influence of structure independent of the structure learning problem (where structure learning is selecting between competing function families)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Experiments</h2>
<h3>1. Bayesian Optimization Interregation Drilling Game</h3>
<h4>Design</h4>
<ul>
<li>subjects start with 2-6 samples (passive samples)</li>
<li>get to choose more samples themselves (active samples)</li>
<li>randomly stopped after 2-6 active samples</li>
<li>get amount of points equal to highest value point seen so far on screen</li>
</ul>
<h4>Analyses</h4>
<ol>
<li>Subjects sensitive to environment structure</li>
<li>GP params fitted to subject behavior relative to actual (i.e. optimal) parameters that generated the hidden functions</li>
<li>BayesOpt aqusition functions predict better than chance</li>
<li>*got negative response in RLDM reviews - thought not compelling enough</li>
<li>BayesOpt aquisition functions predict behavior better than infomax and heuristics</li>
<li>compare expected improvement (EI) and GP-UCB to infomax (ground-truth counter), as well as POLE, and EXAM (Busemeyer heuristics), perhaps polynomial/spline fits as well?</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. (optional?) Function learning Interregation Drilling Game</h3>
<h4>Design</h4>
<ul>
<li>same as BO drilling game except, at interrogation time, probed for how deep it is at a random spot.</li>
<li>amount of points determined by how far away predicted depth is from actual depth</li>
</ul>
<h4>Analyses</h4>
<ol>
<li>Infomax better than BO for explaining active samples - would be nice double dissociation for model fits</li>
<li>* issue: there is a weird disconnect between this, where one has to make a final decision at interrogation time, and experiment 1, where there is no final decision.  may be more appropriate to save for Active Decision Making paper</li>
</ol>
